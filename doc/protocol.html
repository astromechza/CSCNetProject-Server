        <h1>Protocol</h1>
        <p>
            The SensorServer is capable of undestanding a variety of commands sent as JSON text strings. We chose JSON 
            because it provides an unambiguous way of transmitting basic datastructures over http connections in a way 
            that is simple, has low overhead, and is humanly readable for debugging purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We based our protocol on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">JSON-RCP</a> standard, which 
            was designed for sending requests to servers. Our standard is very simple and relies on only a few fixed
            fields:
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : X,           // Any additional data that muse be sent with the command
            "group_id" : N          // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <p>
            If an error occurs, the 'result' field will not be present or will be blank. If you want to check for errors
            rather check the value of the 'error' field
        </p>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : X,           // The result of the command
            "error" :  ""           // Some error message if an error occurs
            "elapsed" : M           // Time in milliseconds taken to process the command. (debug info)
        } </pre>

        <hr>

        <h2> Command: Ping </h2>
        <p>
            This is a very simple command used to check whether the server is online and responing correctly.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "ping",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : "",              // Nothing
            "group_id" : N              // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : "pong"            // The result of the command
        } </pre>

        <hr>

        <h2> Command: Info </h2>
        <p>
            This command is used to ask what types and quantities of data are present on the server. It will return 
            &lt;type>, &lt;count>, &lt;first time recorded>, &lt;last time recorded> for each type of data in the 
            database. Note this does not group by group_id it is just for checking what and how much data is present.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "info",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : "",              // Nothing
            "group_id" : N              // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result": [
                {
                    "name" : "some-type-name",                // Name of the datatype, eg: "temperature"
                    "count" : X,                              // Number of readings
                    "time_from" : "2013-04-08 19:03:22.0",    // First time recorded as an ISO time
                    "time_to" : "2013-04-10 13:53:10.0"       // Last time recorded as an ISO time
                },
                ...
            ]
        } </pre>

        <h2> Command: New Readings </h2>
        <p>
            This command is used by clients to upload data points to the server.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "group_id" : 1,                                 // Group Id
            "method" : "new_readings",                      // new readings method call
            "params" : {    
                "readings" : [                              // an array of readings
                    { 
                        "time" : "2013-04-10 17:50:49.76",    // ISO time string
                        "value" : 1,                          // value as long or integer or float
                        "type" : "light"                      // type as string
                    },
                    ...
                ]
            }
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : "20 records logged."                    // Result of the upload
        } </pre>
