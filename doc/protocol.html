        <h1>Protocol</h1>
        <p>
            The SensorServer is capable of undestanding a variety of commands sent as JSON text strings. We chose JSON 
            because it provides an unambiguous way of transmitting basic datastructures over http connections in a way 
            that is simple, has low overhead, and is humanly readable for debugging purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We based our protocol on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">JSON-RCP</a> standard, which 
            was designed for sending requests to servers. Our standard is very simple and relies on only a few fixed
            fields:
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : X,           // Any additional data that muse be sent with the command
            "group_id" : N          // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <p>
            If an error occurs, the 'result' field will not be present or will be blank. If you want to check for errors
            rather check the value of the 'error' field
        </p>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : X,           // The result of the command
            "error" :  ""           // Some error message if an error occurs
            "elapsed" : M           // Time in milliseconds taken to process the command. (debug info)
        } </pre>

        <hr>

        <h2> Command: Ping </h2>
        <p>
            This is a very simple command used to check whether the server is online and responing correctly.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "ping",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : "",              // Nothing
            "group_id" : N              // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : "pong"            // The result of the command
        } </pre>

        <hr>

        <h2> Command: Info </h2>
        <p>
            This command is used to ask what types and quantities of data are present on the server. It will return 
            &lt;type>, &lt;count>, &lt;first time recorded>, &lt;last time recorded> for each type of data in the 
            database. Note this does not group by group_id it is just for checking what and how much data is present.
            It also returns an array of all the group id's that have recorded data.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "method" : "info",          // The command you wish to perform
            "params" : "",              // Nothing
            "group_id" : N              // The id of the group sending the command
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result": {
                "types" : [
                    {
                        "name" : "some-type-name",                // Name of the datatype, eg: "temperature"
                        "count" : X,                              // Number of readings
                        "time_from" : "2013-04-08 19:03:22.0",    // First time recorded as an ISO time
                        "time_to" : "2013-04-10 13:53:10.0"       // Last time recorded as an ISO time
                    }
                ],
                "groups" : [ 1, 2, 3, ... ]                   // Group Ids
            }
        } </pre>

        <hr>

        <h2> Command: New Readings </h2>
        <p>
            This command is used by clients to upload data points to the server. The client replies with the number of
            records it recorded. Note that this should always be equal to the number of records in the uploaded JSON. 
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "group_id" : 1,                                 // Group Id
            "method" : "new_readings",                      // new readings method call
            "params" : {    
                "readings" : [                              // an array of readings
                    { 
                        "time" : "2013-04-10 17:50:49.76",    // ISO time string
                        "value" : 1,                          // value as long or integer or float
                        "type" : "light"                      // type as string
                    },
                    ...
                ]
            }
        } </pre>
        <h3>Server sends:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "result" : "20 records logged."                    // Result of the upload
        } </pre>

        <h2> Command: Query Readings </h2>
        <p>
            The "query_readings" method is used to return readings that match the specified parameters. There 
            is a difference between a blank array and leaving the "group_ids" or "types". Blank array will return no 
            readings as no readings will match any of the items in the array since there are no items in the array.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "group_id" : 1,

                "types" : [ "temperature", "humidity"]          // Types to return 
                ]

        <h2> Command: Query Logs </h2>
        <p>
            The "query_logs" method is used to return actions from the Logs table in the database.
        </p>

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {

        <h2> Command: Data Summary </h2>
        <p>
            This method provides a straightforward way of getting aggregation data for the various types of data on the server. For each type, a number of numbers are returned:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mean (Average)</li>
            <li>Minimum</li>
            <li>Maximum</li>
            <li>Standard Deviation</li>
            <li>Count</li>
            <li>Median</li>
            <li>Mode</li>

        </ul>   
        <p>
            The summary is cached on the server for susequent calls to "data_summary". When new records are uploaded the cache expires and the 
            data summary is regenerated next time it is requested.
        </p>    

        <h3>Server receives:</h3>
        <pre>
        {
            "group_id" : 1,                                 
            "method" : "query_logs",                       
            "params" : {

                {
                    "min" : 1,
                    "median" : 1,
                    "max" : 1,

        } </pre>

        <h2> Command: Aggregation </h2>
        <p>
            In addition to the data_summary command, there is a command to get a specific aggregation of a specific 
            range of readings. This is substantially faster when the user just want a specific value and is recalculated 
            each time.
        </p>
        <h3>Possible Aggregations are:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>COUNT              "count"</li>
            <li>MEAN               "mean" or "average" or "avg"</li>
            <li>MINIMUM            "min" or "minimum"</li>
            <li>MAXIMUM            "max" or "maximum"</li>
            <li>STANDARD DEVIATION "std" or "stddev" or "stddeviation" or "standarddeviation"</li>
            <li>MODE               "mode"</li>
            <li>MEDIAN             "median"</li>
